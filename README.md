## Plans
* By V 0.5.0 have everyone's sprites working properly.
* Heart events
* Rainy day dialogue
* Have Ross and Shelby visit Caroline more
* Currently dialogue in the museum is broken. There is supposed to be special dialogue for Ross, Shelby, Jacob, and Ana in book club, and for Zech, Jacob, Dylan, Kurtis, and Skye for board game club. Currently it just plays normal daily dialogue. I plan to fix this at some point.
* Created NPCs are romanceable, but I have no idea what happens if you try to marry them. So we'll have to figure that out at some point.
* Make art and special dialogue for dancing at the flower dance.
* During the Dance of the Moonlight Jellies, Zech disappears in the cutscene because the player stands at his location. So, uh, fix that at some point.

## Updates

### V 0.4.0
* All NPCs now have neutral, happy, and sad portraits.
* Added facial expressions to MANY lines of dialogue, and slightly adjusted a few lines.
* Holly is a neutral gift for Skye and Shelby.
* Clay is a neutral gift for Ana.

### V 0.3.8
* Added schedules for the Night Market:
    * Ross, David, and Kurtis visit on Winter 15th
    * Shelby, Jacob, and Dylan visit on Winter 16th
    * Zech, Skye, and Ana visit on Winter 17th
* De-prioritized rainy-day schedules. Basically, if an NPC has a specific schedule for that date, like the night market, then the NPC prioritizes that over their rainy day schedule. Not entirely sure if I should start forcing people to go to book club and board game club on rainy days. Currently they are not forced to go.
* Helped Jacob AGAIN with getting to book club on time.
* Fixed schedule behavior for Spring 6th. On Spring 6th, Ross, Zech, Shelby, Jacob, and Ana have a party at Haley's house.
* Added a dialogue line for Ana that tells the player about the party. The dialogue plays on the 3rd, which is Ana's actual birthday.
* David now visits the Adventure guild on Wednesdays in Summer and Fall.
* Skye and Dylan now don't leave the Adventure Guild on Spring 1st-Spring 4th. This is to prevent them walking through the boulder blocking the mines on year 1. Unfortunately this behavior continues for all years.

### V 0.3.7
* Helped Jacob get to book club faster on Mondays.
* Added the NPCs to the Valley Fair. Edited a line of Jas's dialogue in the fair.
* Added the NPCs to Spirit's Eve.
* Added the NPCs to the Ice Fishing Festival.
* Added the NPCs to the Feast of the Winter Star. All NPCs are possible targets for the "secret gift exchange," and all NPCs can give you gifts for the exchange. All new NPCs are able to gift the tea set. 

### V 0.3.6
* Changed the name of the file as it appears in Vortex to "Ross's Friend Mod".
* Gave Ross's sprites full 360 capabilities. That just leaves David and Zech that can't turn their bodies.
* Gave Skye heterochromia. It just fits them. I can't explain it.
* Fixed the Dance of the Moonlight Jellies. NPCs should appear like normal now.

### V 0.3.5
* Added a janky walking animation for Dylan, only when he walks left to right. It's... an improvement?
* Created a smiling portrait for Dylan. It should be automatically used in some situations, such as liked gifts.
* On Summer 1st, all new NPCs take a trip to the desert via the bus.
* Fixed some situations where NPCs weren't facing the right directions.
* Version 0.3.5b adds mod update capability on the Nexus.

### V 0.3.4
* Inserted NPCs into Flower Dance, Luau, and Dance of the Moonlight Jellies.
* Copied everyone's spring schedules to the other seasons. This may cause some things to break, since some environments change depending on season.

### V 0.3.3

* Updated a few dialogue lines.

### V 0.1.2
* Added letters that come in the mail from each person. The likelihood of getting a letter in the mail is correlated with friendship, just like it is with all NPCs. All new NPCs send gifts with their letters.

* Updated Dylan's sprites, too.
