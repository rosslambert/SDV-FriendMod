# SDV-FriendMod
This mod adds Ross and his friends into the game of Stardew Valley. These 9 NPCs are: Ross, David, Zech, Shelby, Skye, Kurtis, Jacob, Ana, and Dylan.

## Plans
* Figure out where the heck these guys are going to live in the game. The idea of adding a whole new AREA is pretty scary, so they'll probably just live in other villagers' houses.
* By V 0.4.0, finish the daily schedules.
* Consider adding heart events
* Rainy day dialogue
* Festivals
    * ~~Egg Hunt~~
    * Flower Dance
    * Luau
    * Dance of the Jellies
    * Fair
    * Spookfest
    * Ice Fishing
    * Winter's Eve
* Night market pathing and stuff
* More portraits and facial expressions
* Modify facial expressions in dialogue
* Have Ross and Shelby visit Caroline more

* Updated a few dialogue lines.

* Updated Dylan's sprites, too.
