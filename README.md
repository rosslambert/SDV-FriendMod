# SDV-FriendMod
This mod adds Ross and his friends into the game of Stardew Valley. 

## Plans
* By 0.1.0 I would like to include many of my friends to some degree, including Ross, David, Zech, Shelby, Skye, Kurtis, Jacob, Ana, Dylan, and potentially others to come
* Figure out where the heck these guys are going to live in the game. The idea of adding a whole new AREA is pretty scary, so they'll probably just live in other villagers' houses.
* By 0.2.0 Do some sprite work, even if it's really bad. Anything is better than a bunch of Abigail clones.
* Make some schedules. I love the idea of a book club in the library, and maybe a board game group or DnD group (just like real life)
* Make some dialogue.
