### Required Mods
* [SMAPI - Stardew Modding API](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2400)
* [Content Patcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915)

## Plans
* At least one heart event per character. Version 2.1.0 will have plenty of heart events!
* Seems difficult to pull off, but allowing the player to enter Harvey's room when at 2 hearts with David or Ross, or enter Elliot's cabin with 2 hearts with Zech or Shelby, or enter Leah's cabin with 2 hearts with Jacob.
* Add in some custom phone calls? Could be fun.
* Include special compatibility with Ridgeside and SVE.
* Include additional NPCs, Kato, Sam, Jackie, and Shane.

## Bugs
* Many compatibility issues with Ridgeside and SVE. Nothing gamebreaking, but people are standing in places they shouldn't be in the changed maps, especially in festivals like Spirit's Eve.

## Updates

### V 2.0.3
* Added dialogue for the green rain for all characters.
* Changed the schedules for the green rain event for all characters.
* Added Kurtis to the cutscene in which the player meets the wizard for the first time.
* Added a book club event the first time you appear at the museum on a sunny Monday between 10am and 2pm after week 1.
* Added a board game club event the first time you appear at the museum on a sunny Saturday between 1pm and 7pm.
* Improved Kurtis's sprites so his neckerchief looks less like a dog collar and more like a neckerchief.
* Ana now actually has her "art and wine" party with Leah and Shelby. Occurs on clear sundays on the beach in summer around 2pm if the bridge is repaired, so not something you'll run into too often.
* Gave Shelby a better smiling portrait. Does it look weird? Yes. But it's more consistent with the other portraits.
* Ana now has a "drawing" animation that she tends to use on Sundays.
* Jacob now has a "sleepy" animation that he uses during book club.
* Some minor changes to daily schedules.
* Some minor changes to likes and dislikes.
* Added placeholder dialogue for the resort for all characters. I still need to add proper dialogue later.

### V 2.0.2
* Added an event on the beach when the player gets 2 hearts with Shelby.
* Added an event in the Saloon when the player gets 5 hearts with Shelby.
* Added an event in the forest when the player gets 5 hearts with Zech.
* Added an event in the forest when the player gets 8 hearts with Shelby.
* Fixed bugs related to NPC schedules at the bus stop due to a change in how the map works there, especially Shelby.
* Fixed a typo in Ross's schedule that made him stand in a doorway all day on Sundays.
* Added a secret dialogue with Shelby after reaching 8 hearts with her.
* Added some new sprites, a new portrait, and a new animation for Shelby.
* Changed some liked and disliked gifts.
* Fixed the back of Zech's head when he's walking up so it doesn't twitch when he puts his left foot forward.
* Changed where Dylan stands in Pierre's so he doesn't stand inside of Gus.
* Fixed some of Ross's and Shelby's dialogue that wasn't triggering properly due to a typo.

### V 2.0.1
* Changed the way that new NPCs are added to festivals. They should no longer overwrite NPCs from other mods, and should appear properly with all dialogue in 8 festivals.
* Finally (Maybe? Hopefully?) fixed all of the dialogue for book club (museum on Mondays) and board game club (museum on Saturdays).
* Added much dialogue for board game club (museum on Saturdays).
* Added a message that Dylan sends on 22nd of summer, year 1.

### V 2.0.0 (Not compatible with previous versions of the mod)
* Finalized converting to Stardew Valley 1.6 and set content patcher format version to 2.0.0.
* Changed how characters are named internally. They are now 20460_[charactername]. This will fix compatibility issues where custom NPCs in other mods have the same names as the custom NPCs in my mod. This is not compatible with previous versions of the mod!
* Changed some likes/dislikes
* I expect many bugs with this update! The format changes might mess with quite a few things, including quests.

### V 1.0.4
* Actually upload Ana's walking animations, instead of just saying I did.
* Edited 1 line of Skye's dialogue.
* Changed how dialogue was coded in the museum and it's STILL not working properly. Excellent.

### V 1.0.3
* Converted to Stardew Valley 1.6
    * Did NOT set content patcher format version to 2.0.0. Doing so breaks the game, but I plan on updating this once I can get it working.
    * Altered quest format to work with update.
* Modified/Added dialogue:
    * 5 lines of Ana's.
    * 4 lines of Ross's.
    * 4 lines of Shelby's.
    * 4 lines of Jacob's.
    * 2 lines of Kurtis's.
    * 1 line of Zech's.
    * 1 line of David's
* Changed Ross's position in the flower dance so he isn't trampling those new bouquets added in 1.6.

### V 1.0.2
* Replaced the fodder bundle in the community center. It appears in the bulletin board and is called the "Willamette Bundle." Only 6 of the 9 items are required, and the 9 items are each a reference to one of the new NPCs. I do not believe that this is compatible with remixed bundles, but who knows?
* Changed Jacob's introduction dialogue.
* Changed a line of Kurtis's dialogue.

### V 1.0.1
* Trimmed the filesize for the mod on the Nexus.

### V 1.0.0 (FULL RELEASE!)
* Added 9 new quests which appear in the mail. There is one new quest every season for the first nine seasons.
* Zech now has brand new sprites with complete animations in all directions. He lost his hat, though. Sorry, Zech.
* Ross, Shelby, Jacob, and Ana now have travel animations in all directions.
* Bread is now a loved gift for Kurtis.
* Slight alterations to David's, Skye's, and Kurtis's dialogues.

### V 0.4.3
* David now has sprites that face all 4 directions.
* David and Kurtis now have travel animations in all directions.
* Jacob and Ana now have "walking down" animations.
* Ross and Shelby now have "walking up" animations.
* Gave facial expressions to festival dialogue.
* Edited a line of the Wizard's dialogue to mention Kurtis as an apprentice.
* Added a line of dialogue in winter for Zech in reference to his book "The Lords of 10ckn3g0r."
* Edited Ana's happy portrait to make her mouth look less weird.
* Changed everyone's rainy day schedule so they all go to the saloon.
* Made David visit near the mines on Sundays and on some other days.
* Slightly modified Ross's Thursday schedule.

### V 0.4.2
* Dylan now has travel animations in all directions. He looks like he's walking!
* Skye now has travel animations in all directions. They look like they're floating! Or sinking into the earth or something. Look, animations are hard and I thought this was funny.
* Ross, Shelby, and Kurtis now have "walking down" animations.
* Fixed an error where Dylan's "walking right" animation was offset by a pixel, causing graphical glitches.
* Daffodil is now a liked gift for Ross, David, Skye, Kurtis, and Ana.
* Bread is now a liked gift for Skye.
* Gave Shelby a Tuesday schedule in all seasons. (Whoops, I forgot.)
* The added NPCs are no longer datable. Maybe this will be an added feature in the future.
* Slightly edited Ross's location when he's in the saloon.
* Slightly edited Kurtis's locations on Tuesdays.
* Fixed a typo in Kurtis's neutral gift dialogue.

### V 0.4.1
* Dylan now swings his arms when he walks horizontally. Sprite art is hard.
* Ross and Shelby now visit Caroline more often, especially on Fridays in her sunroom.

### V 0.4.0
* All NPCs now have neutral, happy, and sad portraits.
* Added facial expressions to MANY lines of dialogue, and slightly adjusted a few lines.
* Holly is a neutral gift for Skye and Shelby.
* Clay is a neutral gift for Ana.

### V 0.3.8
* Added schedules for the Night Market:
    * Ross, David, and Kurtis visit on Winter 15th
    * Shelby, Jacob, and Dylan visit on Winter 16th
    * Zech, Skye, and Ana visit on Winter 17th
* De-prioritized rainy-day schedules. Basically, if an NPC has a specific schedule for that date, like the night market, then the NPC prioritizes that over their rainy day schedule. Not entirely sure if I should start forcing people to go to book club and board game club on rainy days. Currently they are not forced to go.
* Helped Jacob AGAIN with getting to book club on time.
* Fixed schedule behavior for Spring 6th. On Spring 6th, Ross, Zech, Shelby, Jacob, and Ana have a party at Haley's house.
* Added a dialogue line for Ana that tells the player about the party. The dialogue plays on the 3rd, which is Ana's actual birthday.
* David now visits the Adventure guild on Wednesdays in Summer and Fall.
* Skye and Dylan now don't leave the Adventure Guild on Spring 1st-Spring 4th. This is to prevent them walking through the boulder blocking the mines on year 1. Unfortunately this behavior continues for all years.

### V 0.3.7
* Helped Jacob get to book club faster on Mondays.
* Added the NPCs to the Valley Fair. Edited a line of Jas's dialogue in the fair.
* Added the NPCs to Spirit's Eve.
* Added the NPCs to the Ice Fishing Festival.
* Added the NPCs to the Feast of the Winter Star. All NPCs are possible targets for the "secret gift exchange," and all NPCs can give you gifts for the exchange. All new NPCs are able to gift the tea set. 

### V 0.3.6
* Changed the name of the file as it appears in Vortex to "Ross's Friend Mod".
* Gave Ross's sprites full 360 capabilities. That just leaves David and Zech that can't turn their bodies.
* Gave Skye heterochromia. It just fits them. I can't explain it.
* Fixed the Dance of the Moonlight Jellies. NPCs should appear like normal now.

### V 0.3.5
* Added a janky walking animation for Dylan, only when he walks left to right. It's... an improvement?
* Created a smiling portrait for Dylan. It should be automatically used in some situations, such as liked gifts.
* On Summer 1st, all new NPCs take a trip to the desert via the bus.
* Fixed some situations where NPCs weren't facing the right directions.
* Version 0.3.5b adds mod update capability on the Nexus.

### V 0.3.4
* Inserted NPCs into Flower Dance, Luau, and Dance of the Moonlight Jellies.
* Copied everyone's spring schedules to the other seasons. This may cause some things to break, since some environments change depending on season.

### V 0.3.3

### V 0.2.2

### V 0.2.1
* Everyone appears in the egg hunt with proper dialogue

### V 0.2.0 (The Sprite Update)

* Updated a few dialogue lines.

### V 0.1.2
* Added letters that come in the mail from each person. The likelihood of getting a letter in the mail is correlated with friendship, just like it is with all NPCs. All new NPCs send gifts with their letters.

* Updated Dylan's sprites, too.
* Updated some of David's daily dialogue.

* Added some unique dialogue for Ross, and changed his schedule for mondays in Spring.
* Updated Ross's, David's, and Zech's sprites. They just kinda glide around and always face the camera.


### V 0.0.7

* (Still need to adjust his likes and dislikes, portrait)

### V 0.0.6
