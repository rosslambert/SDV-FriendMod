# SDV-FriendMod
This mod adds Ross and his friends into the game of Stardew Valley. 

## Plans
* Figure out where the heck these guys are going to live in the game. The idea of adding a whole new AREA is pretty scary, so they'll probably just live in other villagers' houses.
* By 0.2.0 Do some sprite work, even if it's really bad. Anything is better than a bunch of Abigail clones.
* Make some schedules. I love the idea of a book club in the library, and maybe a board game group or DnD group
* Make some dialogue. 
* Have them send stuff in the mail with friendship
* Consider adding events, but that seems daunting

## Updates

### V 0.1.1
* Altered multiple scheduled routes. For example, Ross goes to the library on mondays for book club, and he goes to the saloon on fridays.
* Gave daily dialogue for Ross.
* Altered other dialogue.

### V 0.1.0
* Added Jacob, Ana, and Dylan to the game. They all spawn at the bus stop. Their birthdays are Winter 19, Spring 3, and Spring 21 respectively.
* Finished Kurtis's, Jacob's, Ana's, and Dylan's likes/dislikes. At least, for now.
* Added some unique dialogue for Ross, and changed his schedule for mondays in Spring.
* Updated Ross's, David's, and Zech's sprites. They just kinda glide around and always face the camera.

* (Still need to adjust his likes and dislikes, portrait)

### V 0.0.6
