## Plans
* By V 0.4.0, finish the daily schedules.
* Consider adding heart events
* Rainy day dialogue
* Festivals
    * ~~Egg Hunt~~
    * ~~Flower Dance~~
    * ~~Luau~~
    * ~~Dance of the Moonlight Jellies~~
    * Fair
    * Spookfest
    * Ice Fishing
    * Winter's Eve
* Night market pathing and stuff
* More portraits and facial expressions
* Modify facial expressions in dialogue
* Have Ross and Shelby visit Caroline more
* Currently dialogue in the museum is broken. There is supposed to be special dialogue for Ross, Shelby, Jacob, and Ana in book club, and for Zech, Jacob, Dylan, Kurtis, and Skye for board game club. Currently it just plays normal daily dialogue. I plan to fix this at some point.
* Created NPCs are romanceable, but I have no idea what happens if you try to marry them. So we'll have to figure that out at some point.
* Have all NPCs meet up at Haley's house on Spring 6th to celebrate Ana's birthday. Currently behavior on Spring 6th is very broken.
* Make art and special dialogue for dancing at the flower dance.

## Updates

### V 0.3.5
* Added a janky walking animation for Dylan, only when he walks left to right. It's... an improvement?
* Created a smiling portrait for Dylan. It should be automatically used in some situations, such as liked gifts.
* On Summer 1st, all new NPCs take a trip to the desert via the bus.
* Fixed some situations where NPCs weren't facing the right directions.

### V 0.3.4
* Inserted NPCs into Flower Dance, Luau, and Dance of the Moonlight Jellies.
* Copied everyone's spring schedules to the other seasons. This may cause some things to break, since some environments change depending on season.

### V 0.3.3
* Set Kurtis's, Jacob's, Ana's, and Dylan's daily schedules in Spring. Now everyone has schedules for Spring! Yay!
* Changed Ross's, David's, Shelby's, Skye's, and Kurtis's intro dialogues.

### V 0.2.0 (The Sprite Update)

* Updated a few dialogue lines.

### V 0.1.2
* Added letters that come in the mail from each person. The likelihood of getting a letter in the mail is correlated with friendship, just like it is with all NPCs. All new NPCs send gifts with their letters.

* Updated Dylan's sprites, too.
