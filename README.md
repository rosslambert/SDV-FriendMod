# SDV-FriendMod
This mod adds Ross and his friends into the game of Stardew Valley. These 9 NPCs are: Ross, David, Zech, Shelby, Skye, Kurtis, Jacob, Ana, and Dylan.

## Plans
* Figure out where the heck these guys are going to live in the game. The idea of adding a whole new AREA is pretty scary, so they'll probably just live in other villagers' houses.
* Make some schedules. I love the idea of a book club in the library, and maybe a board game group or DnD group
* By V 0.3.0, finish all the daily dialogue.
* Dialogue 21% (55/252)
    * Ross:     28/28 daily dialogue
    * David:    10/28 daily dialogue
    * Zech:     3/28 daily dialogue
    * Shelby:   2/28 daily dialogue
    * Skye:     1/28 daily dialogue
    * Kurtis:   5/28 daily dialogue
    * Jacob:    1/28 daily dialogue
    * Ana:      1/28 daily dialogue
    * Dylan:    4/28 daily dialogue
* Consider adding events
* Rainy day dialogue
* Festivals
    * ~~Egg Hunt~~
    * Flower Dance
    * Luau
    * Dance of the Jellies
    * Fair
    * Spookfest
    * Ice Fishing
    * Winter's Eve
* Night market pathing and stuff

## Updates

### V 0.2.1
* Everyone appears in the egg hunt with proper dialogue

### V 0.2.0
* Everyone has sprites! Are they good sprites? Eh. Do they all have animations? Heck no! They can't even all turn to the left and right. But hey, it's something!
* Updated a few dialogue lines.

### V 0.1.2
* Added letters that come in the mail from each person. The likelihood of getting a letter in the mail is correlated with friendship, just like it is with all NPCs. All new NPCs send gifts with their letters.
* Updated Ana's sprites. She can look up and to the left and right! Still no walking animation though lol.
* Updated Dylan's sprites, too.
* Updated some of David's daily dialogue.

### V 0.1.1
* Altered multiple scheduled routes. For example, Ross goes to the library on mondays for book club, and he goes to the saloon on fridays.
* Gave daily dialogue for Ross.
* Altered other dialogue.

### V 0.1.0
* Added Jacob, Ana, and Dylan to the game. They all spawn at the bus stop. Their birthdays are Winter 19, Spring 3, and Spring 21 respectively.
